# Image_classification
Image classification is a computer vision task where algorithms automatically categorize images into predefined classes or labels. Deep learning models, typically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), analyze pixel patterns, shapes, colors, and textures to identify objects, scenes, or concepts within images with high accuracy.
